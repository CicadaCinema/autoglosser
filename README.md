## Changes to savefile formats `.agmap` and `.agtext`

- [9629ea7](https://github.com/CicadaCinema/autoglosser/commit/9629ea7f52891c13d46906127f94711f10ffa0ae) introduced a change which stopped saving the `FullMap._sourceToMappings` field in the `.agmap` savefile. You can load old savefiles into the new version but you cannot load new savefiles into the old version.
- [d5561a7](https://github.com/CicadaCinema/autoglosser/commit/d5561a762b49840006d57da4b7cfc6b8aa9c9b28) introduced a change which relies on the fact that the mappings are sorted alphabetically by pronunciation in their map section during the runtime of the program. As a temporary measure, any imported maps are sorted beforehand. Therefore you can both load old savefiles into the new version and load new savefiles into the old version.
- [9c94e81](https://github.com/CicadaCinema/autoglosser/commit/9c94e81315ee1aca9ef2f9eb496e3ad8cbf6c2bc) modified the sorting order introduced in the change above.
- [71e70e8](https://github.com/CicadaCinema/autoglosser/commit/71e70e8a91fce41ad6b8acf0f6168144ac7c2102) modified the sorting order again.

## Usage

- When saving an `.agtext` or an `.agmap`, you cannot overwrite files. Autoglosser will display no error, but the old file will not be overwritten and the new file will not be saved anywhere.
- In Map mode, press enter to save the modification you have made to a mapping.

## Compiling the exported `.tex` file

Use the XeLaTeX compiler. You must also have the xeCJK package installed.
